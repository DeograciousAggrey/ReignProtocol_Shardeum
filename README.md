Reign Protocol operates as a decentralized credit infrastructure provider, facilitating connections between digital asset (crypto) investors and investment opportunities tied to small and medium-sized business (SMB) economic activities. Our platform demonstrates the practical application of a Credit Fund functioning as a borrower, which in turn aggregates and lends to small businesses.

We strongly believe that embracing decentralized finance can effectively address the financial inclusion challenge by offering the following advantages:

### For Borrowers:
- Access to global digital asset liquidity, providing a sustainable and cost-effective solution for borrowers in emerging markets.
- Utilization of Blockchain-based on-chain borrowing, ensuring speed, security, and the creation of an immutable credit history that can attract significant capital inflows.

### For Investors:
- Empowerment of any digital asset holder to participate as a lender, supporting real-world economic activities.
- Provision of stable and sustainable yields ranging from 10% to 25%, independent of cryptocurrency market volatility.
